A test suite is a complete set of test cases, possibly combined into groups or modules (e.g. for use cases
or domains like AC, DC charging), that are necessary to perform conformance testing for a given SUT.  

In each test case, the SUT is stimulated with specific inputs and the reactions are observed and
evaluated.  


In reference to the test case modelling as defined in the previous subclause, a stimulus is always sent
from the tester to the SUT as part of the test behavior.  
Due to the strictly defined client, server roles
assigned to the EVCC and SECC respectively, this result in the following two message handling
paradigms depending on the type of the SUT.
