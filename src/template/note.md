A	template	defines	at	least	one	value	for	a	data	type.	The	templates	in	this	document	are	used	for	two
purposes:
—	 representation	of	stimulus	test	data;	and
—	 SUT	response	matching	with	expected	behavior.

The	templates	for	the	SLAC	messages	consist	of	a	header	(MME_Header)	and	a	payload	(MME_Payload).
There	are	templates	that	can	be	parameterized.	At	least	one	template	for	each	message	exists,	where	all
elements	of	the	first	level	of	the	message	type	are	defined	as	parameters	of	the	template.
